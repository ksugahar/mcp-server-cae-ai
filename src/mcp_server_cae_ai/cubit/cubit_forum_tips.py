# Mesh Quality Improvement Techniques

## Condition Number Smoothing (Fix Negative Jacobians)

After meshing, if elements have bad quality or negative Jacobians, apply
condition number smoothing:

```python
# Standard smoothing
cubit.cmd("volume all smooth scheme condition number beta 2.0 cpu 0.5")
cubit.cmd("smooth volume all")
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `beta` | Aggressiveness (2.0 is typical) |
| `cpu` | Max CPU time in seconds per volume |

This is **the most common fix** for bad elements after meshing complex
Boolean/webcut geometry with polyhedral or tetmesh schemes.

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/2636 (Bad Quality Shear Hex Generated)

## Quality Diagnostics

```python
# Check shape quality (0=bad, 1=ideal)
cubit.cmd("quality volume all shape")

# Check aspect ratio
cubit.cmd("quality volume all aspect ratio")

# Check Jacobian (negative = inverted element)
cubit.cmd("quality volume all jacobian")

# Check scaled Jacobian (normalized, -1 to 1)
cubit.cmd("quality volume all scaled jacobian")
```

## Smoothing After Hex Meshing

For hex meshes on complex decomposed geometry:
```python
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme auto")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")

# Post-mesh smoothing
cubit.cmd("volume all smooth scheme condition number beta 2.0 cpu 0.5")
cubit.cmd("smooth volume all")
```

## Node Constraint for 2nd Order Curved Elements

To force mid-edge nodes to conform to curved geometry:
```python
cubit.cmd("set node constraint on")
```

Without this, 2nd order mid-nodes form straight lines between corner nodes
rather than following the surface curvature.

FORUM_BIASED_GRADED = """
# Biased and Graded Meshing Techniques

## Curve Bias (Size Gradation Along a Direction)

Create mesh that transitions from fine to coarse along a curve:

```python
# Bias from vertex 1 (fine) to vertex 2 (coarse)
cubit.cmd("curve 4 scheme bias fine size 0.005 coarse size 0.05 start vertex 1")

# Propagate the bias through the volume
cubit.cmd("propagate curve bias volume 1")
```

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/2700 (Cylindrical geometry refined near top)

## Circle Scheme (Radial Gradation)

Control radial mesh density on circular surfaces:

```python
# 16 angular divisions, inner core at 5% of radius
cubit.cmd("surface 2 scheme circle interval 16 fraction 0.05")
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `interval` | Number of elements around circumference |
| `fraction` | Fraction of radius for inner mesh core (0-1) |

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/2700

## Size Auto Factor (Automatic Size Control)

Let Cubit auto-determine element size with a scale factor:

```python
# Coarser (factor 10 = larger elements)
cubit.cmd("volume 1 size auto factor 10")

# Finer (factor 3 = smaller elements)
cubit.cmd("volume 2 size auto factor 3")
```

The factor is relative: higher = coarser, lower = finer. Useful when
different regions need different mesh densities:

```python
# Fine mesh near feature, coarse elsewhere
cubit.cmd("volume 5 6 7 8 size auto factor 5")    # Near feature
cubit.cmd("volume 1 2 3 4 size auto factor 10")   # Far from feature
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
```

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/2503 (Crack model with graded mesh)

## Surface Refinement by Depth

Refine near a specific surface, with decreasing density away from it:

```python
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
cubit.cmd("refine volume all using surface 7 depth 2")
```

The `depth` parameter controls how many layers of elements are refined.

# Geometry Decomposition for Hex Meshing

## Webcut + Imprint + Merge Pattern

The standard pattern for decomposing geometry into hex-meshable sub-volumes:

```python
# 1. Create or import geometry
cubit.cmd("create brick x 2 y 2 z 2")
cubit.cmd("create sphere radius 0.5")

## Torus: Webcut to Enable Sweep

A torus cannot be sweep-meshed as-is (no cross-section). Cut it first:

```python
cubit.cmd("create torus major radius 1 minor radius 0.1")
cubit.cmd("webcut volume all with plane yplane offset 0")
cubit.cmd("imprint volume all")
cubit.cmd("merge volume all")

## Brick with Embedded Sphere

Use webcuts + separate sizing per volume:

```python
cubit.cmd("brick x 1")
cubit.cmd("sphere radius 0.05")

# Webcut for symmetric decomposition
cubit.cmd("webcut volume all with plane xplane offset 0")
cubit.cmd("webcut volume all with plane yplane offset 0")
cubit.cmd("webcut volume all with plane zplane offset 0")

# Remove unwanted octants (for quarter/eighth symmetry)
cubit.cmd("delete volume with x_coord < 0")
cubit.cmd("delete volume with y_coord < 0")
cubit.cmd("delete volume with z_coord < 0")

# Boolean
cubit.cmd("subtract body 6 from body 5 keep_tool")

cubit.cmd("volume 5 size auto factor 10")   # Brick: coarse
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
```

## Angle-Based Compositing (Fillet/Sliver Cleanup)

Simplify geometry by compositing faces connected at small dihedral angles:

```
Workflow:
1. Select faces by dihedral angle (~1 degree max)
2. Keep anchor surfaces at boundaries
3. Composite the selection
4. Mesh coarse first, evaluate, then refine
```

For solid-mechanics workflows, higher-order tets can represent curvature
without needing the small CAD features resolved in the mesh.

## When Hex Meshing Fails: "Not mappable, submappable or sweepable"

```
WARNING: Volume 5 must have its meshing scheme explicitly specified;
it is not automatically mappable, submappable or sweepable.
```

**Solutions** (try in order):
1. Further webcut decomposition
2. Set `scheme tetmesh` for problematic volumes
3. Use `scheme polyhedron` (poly-hex) for complex volumes
4. Give up on hex, use `volume all scheme tetmesh`

```python
# Try polyhedron for complex volumes
cubit.cmd("volume 5 scheme polyhedron")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume 5")

# Post-mesh smoothing often needed

# Sweep Meshing Tips

## Exact Sweep with Transform Translate

When sweep meshing deforms the target surface mesh (source and target don't
match), use `sweep transform translate`:

```python
cubit.cmd("volume 1 redistribute nodes off")
cubit.cmd("volume 1 scheme sweep source surface 1 target surface 2 "
          "sweep transform translate propagate bias")
cubit.cmd("volume 1 autosmooth target off")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume 1")
```

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `redistribute nodes off` | Don't redistribute nodes during sweep |
| `sweep transform translate` | Project source mesh exactly to target |
| `autosmooth target off` | Don't smooth the target surface |

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/469 (3067 views - Sweep source/target matching)

## Copy Mesh for Periodic/Cyclic Boundary Conditions

For meshes requiring identical faces (e.g., cyclic symmetry in OpenFOAM):

```python
# 1. Create matching topology by copying/imprinting
cubit.cmd("volume 1 copy rotate 60 about z")
cubit.cmd("volume 1 copy rotate -60 about z")
cubit.cmd("imprint volume all")
cubit.cmd("delete volume 2 3")

# 2. Set mesh size and mesh first surface
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("volume all size auto factor 5")
cubit.cmd("mesh surface 1")   # Mesh one side first

# 3. Copy mesh to opposite surface
cubit.cmd("copy mesh surface 1 onto surface 4")

# 4. Mesh the volume
cubit.cmd("mesh volume 1")
```

The key: imprinting ensures matching topology on both faces.

Source: forum.coreform.com/t/2507 (Copy surface mesh for cyclic condition)

## Interval Matching: Over-Constrained Systems

When sweep meshing fails with "Matching intervals UNSUCCESSFUL":

```
ERROR: Matching intervals <<< UNSUCCESSFUL >>>
```

**Cause**: Linking surfaces between already-meshed volumes are over-constrained.
Setting additional hard intervals on curves that are already determined by
adjacent meshes leads to conflicting constraints.

**Fix**: Don't set intervals on curves that belong to linking surfaces between
meshed and unmeshed volumes. Let Cubit resolve them automatically.

## Process-Based Parallelization (Python)

For meshing assemblies with independent parts, use Python's multiprocessing:

```python

def mesh_part(cub5_file):
    \"\"\"Mesh a single .cub5 file in a subprocess.\"\"\"
    import cubit
    cubit.init(['cubit', '-nojournal', '-batch'])

    parts = list(Path("parts/").glob("*.cub5"))
    with multiprocessing.Pool(4) as pool:
        pool.map(mesh_part, parts)

# Get Exodus-ordered connectivity
nodes = cubit.get_expanded_connectivity("hex", hex_id)

# Map from Exodus HEX20 to CalculiX C3D20 ordering:
# exodus_to_calculix = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,19,12,13,14,15]

# Run a Python script directly

## STL/Faceted Geometry: Set Geometry Engine

When mixing STL imports with CSG operations (brick, cylinder, etc.):

```python
# Import STL files first
cubit.cmd('import stl "part1.stl" feature_angle 135.0 merge stitch')
cubit.cmd('import stl "part2.stl" feature_angle 135.0 merge stitch')

# Switch to facet engine BEFORE creating CSG primitives
cubit.cmd("set geometry engine facet")
cubit.cmd("create brick bounding box volume all extended percentage 50")

# Boolean operations now work
cubit.cmd("subtract volume 1 from volume 3 keep")
```

Without `set geometry engine facet`, you get: "Objects for Booleans must
first be classified" error.

## Element Numbering Consistency

After webcuts, element and node IDs may change. To get consistent numbering:

# For multiple STL files representing different regions

When importing CAD with internal cavities, Cubit may not recognize
internal voids. Fix with healing:

# Method 2: Autoheal with rebuild (more thorough)
cubit.cmd('import step "model.step"')
cubit.cmd("healer autoheal volume all rebuild")

# Then proceed with bounding/subtraction
cubit.cmd("create brick bounding box volume 1 tight")
cubit.cmd("subtract body 1 from body 2 keep_tool")

Without healing, `subtract` may produce only one volume instead of
separating the void region.

## Fix: "Reversal Nodes Found" Error

When boundary layer fails with "Reversal Nodes Found" and
"Boundary layer on surface is invalid", two root causes exist:

1. **Merged surfaces between volumes** create interface complications
2. **Multiple individual surfaces** in boundary layer definition

**Solution**: Delete merged volume early + use composite surface:

```python
# Step 1: Create geometry with Boolean merge
cubit.cmd("create brick 10 5 5")
cubit.cmd("create brick 10 5 5")
cubit.cmd("move vol 2 x 10")
cubit.cmd("merge vol all")

# Step 2: Delete the merged volume IMMEDIATELY (key step!)
cubit.cmd("delete vol 2")

# Step 3: Create composite from multiple BL surfaces
# Instead of referencing surfaces individually (causes reversal nodes),
# consolidate them into a single composite surface
cubit.cmd("composite create surface 4 5 10 11 12 15 16 17")

# Step 4: Set up boundary layer on the composite surface
cubit.cmd("create boundary_layer 1")
cubit.cmd("boundary_layer 1 first_row_height 0.001")
cubit.cmd("boundary_layer 1 growth_factor 1.2")
cubit.cmd("boundary_layer 1 num_rows 10")
# Reference ONLY the composite surface (e.g., surface 24)
cubit.cmd("modify boundary_layer 1 add surface 24 volume 1")

# Step 5: Mesh, then reflect and merge afterward
cubit.cmd("volume 1 scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume 1")
cubit.cmd("volume 1 copy reflect z")
cubit.cmd("merge vol all")
```

**Key insights**:
- `composite create surface` groups multiple surfaces into one entity,
  preventing BL conflicts at surface intersections
- Delete merged volumes BEFORE meshing, not after
- Reflect and merge AFTER meshing (not before)

# Get all hex IDs in a volume
hex_ids = cubit.parse_cubit_list("hex", "all in volume 1")

# Query quality for each element
quality_values = []
for hid in hex_ids:
    q = cubit.get_quality_value("hex", hid, "scaled jacobian")
    quality_values.append(q)

# Find bad elements
bad_ids = [hex_ids[i] for i, q in enumerate(quality_values)
           if q < 0]
print(f"Elements with negative Jacobian: {bad_ids}")
```

## Available Quality Metrics

| Metric | Description | Ideal |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `scaled jacobian` | Normalized Jacobian (-1 to 1) | 1.0 |
| `shape` | Element shape quality (0 to 1) | 1.0 |
| `aspect ratio` | Edge length ratio (1 to inf) | 1.0 |
| `jacobian` | Raw Jacobian (negative = inverted) | > 0 |
| `condition` | Condition number (1 to inf) | 1.0 |

```python
# Visualize bad elements
cubit.cmd("quality volume all scaled jacobian high 0 draw mesh")

# Select elements by coordinate range
cubit.cmd("draw tet all with x_coord > -0.1 And x_coord < 0.1")

# Refine elements near a plane
cubit.cmd("refine tet all with x_coord > -0.1 And x_coord < 0.1 numsplit 1")
```

## Global Element IDs vs Cubit IDs

```python
# Get the Cubit hex ID
hex_id = cubit.get_volume_hexes(1)

# Convert to global (Exodus/Abaqus) element ID
global_id = cubit.get_global_element_id("hex", hex_id[0])

# Compress IDs to remove gaps after webcut
cubit.cmd("compress ids")
```

## Reverse Element Normals (Right-Hand Rule)

When a solver complains about left-handed elements:

```python
# Check normals
cubit.cmd("draw face all normal")

# Reverse normals on a surface
cubit.cmd("reverse face in surface 1 all")
```

## FEniCS / FEniCSx (dolfinx)

Export as Exodus, convert to XDMF using `mesh_converter`:

```python
# In Cubit: export Exodus mesh
cubit.cmd("block 1 add volume 1")
cubit.cmd("sideset 1 add surface 3 4")
cubit.cmd('export mesh "mesh.exo" overwrite')
```

```python
# Outside Cubit: convert Exodus → XDMF
# pip install mesh_converter  (or use jorgensd/mesh_converter)
# mesh_converter mesh.exo mesh.xdmf

# In dolfinx:
from dolfinx import io
from mpi4py import MPI
with io.XDMFFile(MPI.COMM_WORLD, "mesh.xdmf", "r") as f:
    msh = f.read_mesh(name="Mesh")
    block_data = f.read_meshtags(msh, name="Mesh")
```

## VTK / VTU Export

Cubit does **not** have a built-in VTK writer. Options:

1. **cubit_mesh_export** module (this project):
   ```python
   import cubit_mesh_export
   cubit_mesh_export.export_vtk(cubit, "mesh.vtk")
   cubit_mesh_export.export_vtu(cubit, "mesh.vtu")
   ```

2. **MeshIO** conversion:
   ```python
   # Export as Exodus from Cubit, then convert
   cubit.cmd('export mesh "mesh.exo" overwrite')
   # meshio convert mesh.exo mesh.vtu
   ```

3. **ParaView** can read Exodus directly.

## CalculiX (C3D20 Node Ordering)

Cubit uses Exodus node ordering. CalculiX uses different ordering
for HEX20 (C3D20). Map mid-face nodes:

```python
# Exodus HEX20 → CalculiX C3D20 reordering
# Nodes 12-15 and 16-19 are swapped
exodus_to_ccx = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,16,17,18,19,12,13,14,15]

nodes = cubit.get_expanded_connectivity("hex", hex_id)
ccx_nodes = [nodes[i] for i in exodus_to_ccx]
```

## OpenFOAM Export

```python
cubit.cmd('export openfoam "/path/to/case" overwrite')
```

**Limitations**: Materials/block data are not exported to OpenFOAM format.
Only boundary, faces, neighbour, owner, and points files are created.

## Group Names and Material Properties (Custom Export)

```python
# Get group names and IDs
names_ids = cubit.group_names_ids()
for name, gid in names_ids:
    print(f"Group '{name}' = ID {gid}")

# Get material from block
material_id = cubit.get_block_material(block_id)
material_name = cubit.get_material_name(material_id)

# Advanced Meshing Techniques

## Volume with Internal Void (Cylinder Inside Brick)

```python
# Method 1: Decompose for hex meshing
cubit.cmd("brick x 10")
cubit.cmd("cylinder height 3 radius 2")
cubit.cmd("subtract body 2 from body 1 keep")
cubit.cmd("delete volume 1")
# Webcut to create sweepable volumes
cubit.cmd("webcut volume 3 with sheet extended from surface 7")
cubit.cmd("merge volume all")
cubit.cmd("volume all size auto factor 2")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")

# Method 2: Tet + THex (simpler but lower quality)
cubit.cmd("merge volume all")
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
cubit.cmd("thex volume all")
```

## Crack/Fracture Geometry (Embedded Surface)

Create a surface inside a volume for crack simulation:

```python
# Method: Non-manifold body via subtract
cubit.cmd("brick x 10 y 10 z 10")
cubit.cmd("surface 6 copy scale x 0.0001 y 0.5 z 0.5")
# Subtract sheet to create non-manifold body
cubit.cmd("subtract body 2 from body 1")
# The tet-mesher handles non-manifold correctly
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
```

The key: subtracting a zero-thickness sheet creates a non-manifold
body where the tet-mesher respects the internal surface.

## Hemisphere Hex Meshing

```python
cubit.cmd("sphere radius 1")
cubit.cmd("brick x 8")
# Quarter symmetry
cubit.cmd("webcut volume all with plane xplane offset 0")
cubit.cmd("delete volume 3 4")
cubit.cmd("subtract volume 1 from volume 2 keep_tool")
cubit.cmd("compress ids")
cubit.cmd("imprint volume all")
cubit.cmd("merge volume all")
# Set scheme
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme auto")
cubit.cmd("volume all size auto factor 5")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
```

For hex meshing curved geometry: the decomposition-sweep strategy
is essential. Watch the Coreform hex meshing webinar for the
fundamental sweep-based approach.

## Dome Volume Meshing

For dome shapes created from swept cross-sections, decompose
the dome into multiple sweep-meshable sections. Key insight:
do not try to sweep through a singularity at the top. Instead:

1. Leave an opening at the dome apex
2. Create a separate cylinder/plug for the opening
3. Webcut the dome into half and mesh each section
4. Use imprint+merge for conformal interface

## Plate with Circular Hole (Quad Mesh)

For high-quality quad meshes around circular holes, use `polyhedron`
scheme instead of default `paving`:

```python
cubit.cmd("surface all scheme polyhedron")
cubit.cmd("surface all size 2")
cubit.cmd("mesh surface all")
```

Or decompose with O-grid for perfect radial meshes:

```python
# Create geometry
cubit.cmd("create surface rectangle width 100 height 50 zplane")
cubit.cmd("create surface circle radius 10 zplane")
cubit.cmd("subtract surface 2 from surface 1")

# For structured mesh, webcut + circle scheme:
cubit.cmd("surface all scheme polyhedron")
cubit.cmd("mesh surface all")
```

## Topography Surface from Structured Data

Create a CAD surface from (x, y, z) grid data:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create vertices from data
for row in data:
    for x, y, z in row:
        cubit.cmd(f"create vertex {x} {y} {z}")

# Create spline curves through rows of vertices
for row_vertices in vertex_rows:
    ids = " ".join(str(v) for v in row_vertices)
    cubit.cmd(f"create curve spline location vertex {ids} delete")

# Skin curves into surface
curve_ids = " ".join(str(c) for c in all_curves)
cubit.cmd(f"create surface skin curve {curve_ids}")

# Mesh the surface
cubit.cmd(f"surface {surf_id} size auto factor 5")
cubit.cmd(f"mesh surface {surf_id}")
```

## External Faces Sideset (All Unmerged Surfaces)

```python
# All unmerged surfaces are external
sids = cubit.parse_cubit_list("surface", "all with is_merged=false")
face_ids = cubit.parse_cubit_list("face",
    f"in surface {' '.join(str(s) for s in sids)}")
cubit.cmd(f"sideset 1 add surface {' '.join(str(s) for s in sids)}")
cubit.cmd(f"nodeset 1 add surface {' '.join(str(s) for s in sids)}")

## THex: Convert Tet Mesh to Hex

```python
cubit.cmd("volume all scheme tetmesh")
cubit.cmd("mesh volume all")
cubit.cmd("thex volume all")

# Post-smoothing usually needed
cubit.cmd("volume all smooth scheme condition number beta 2.0 cpu 0.5")
cubit.cmd("smooth volume all")
```

**Note**: THex creates lower quality hexes than direct hex meshing.
Quality depends heavily on the input tet mesh quality.

## High-Order Element Conversion via Exodus Reimport

To convert imported meshes to high-order while preserving geometry:

```python
# 1. Export current mesh as Exodus
cubit.cmd('export mesh "mesh.exo" overwrite')

# 2. Reimport with geometry interpolation
cubit.cmd('import mesh geometry "mesh.exo" feature_angle 135')
# Use "linear", "spline", or "gradient" interpolation

# 3. Convert to high order
cubit.cmd("block all element type hex20")

# 4. Smooth to fix any inversions
cubit.cmd("volume all smooth scheme condition number beta 2.0 cpu 0.5")
cubit.cmd("smooth volume all")
```
